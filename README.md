# AutosRUs_Analysis_UsingR

## Overview:
   
   Analyzed AutosRUs manufacturing data and suspension coil data. Created different model based on different 
   independent variable to compared it against our dependent variable miles per gallon .
   
   
## Analysis:
 
  As a initial analyzes created 3 linear models to see the influence of Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, 
  Ground Clearance compare against our dependent variable mpg.
    
  Linear Model 1:
    
  Comparing our independent variable Vehicle Length against dependent variable mpg.![mpg vs Vehicle length](images/LM_VehicleLengthVsMPG.png)
  
  Linear Model 2:
  
  Comparing our independent variable Vehicle Weight against dependent variable mpg.![mpg vs Vehicle weight](images/LM_VehicleWeightVsMPG.png)
  
  Linear Model 3:
  
  Comparing our independent variable Ground Clearance against dependent variable mpg.![mpg vs Ground clearance](images/LM_GroundClearanceVsMPG.png)
  
  Based on the three models it seems Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance seems to have slope of zero and more releance to mpg.
