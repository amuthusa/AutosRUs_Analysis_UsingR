1.Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

[Answer]: Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance variables are statistically unlikely to provide non-random 
amount of variance, so they have strong impact on mileage or miles per gallon. Look at the below correlation
matric data

                 vehicle length vehicle weight ground clearance         AWD         mpg
vehicle length       1.00000000    -0.12271790      -0.31663112  0.08565668  0.60947984
vehicle weight      -0.12271790     1.00000000       0.08511338 -0.03698098  0.09068314
ground clearance    -0.31663112     0.08511338       1.00000000 -0.15214456  0.32874886
AWD                  0.08565668    -0.03698098      -0.15214456  1.00000000 -0.14166977
mpg                  0.60947984     0.09068314       0.32874886 -0.14166977  1.00000000

r < 0.3 has no relevance, so AWD and Vehicle Weight are eliminated since they have 0.09 and -0.14
0.3 <= r < 0.5 has weak relationship, so ground clearance has relevance but its weak
05 <= r < 0.7 has moderate relationship, so vehicle length has moderate relevance
r <= 0.7 has strong relationship, there is non based on dataset


2.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

[Answer]: Please find the multiple linear regression using independent variables

Coefficients:
                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)        -9.728e+01  1.448e+01  -6.717 2.68e-08 ***
`vehicle length`    6.233e+00  6.550e-01   9.516 2.40e-12 ***
`vehicle weight`    1.169e-03  6.857e-04   1.706    0.095 .  
`ground clearance`  3.419e+00  5.276e-01   6.481 6.03e-08 ***
AWD                -3.749e+00  2.515e+00  -1.490    0.143    
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Where Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance seems to have slope value as 0, which mean as Vehicle Length
increases the mpg increases in positive relation same with ground clearance. By plotting we could see 
the line is positive increase for both the independent variables


3.Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

[Answer]: By doing multiple model and using backward elimination, I feel both Vehicle Length and Ground
Clearance as independent variable which could be used to predict mpg. Look at the below model

multi_model4 <- lm(mpg ~ `vehicle length` + `ground clearance`, mechacar_mpg)
summary(multi_model4)

Residual standard error: 8.781 on 45 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.708,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.682 
F-statistic: 27.27 on 4 and 45 DF,  p-value: 1.586e-11

Though Multiple R-squared which is 0.708 which would be a good indicator of future prediction based on the 
datamodel, the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05 which make me to think there are other variables
 which might impact mpg but missing from our dataset. Short answer the model is effective for this dataset 
 but can't be genralized for all MechaCar prototypes


 Suspension Coil Summary:

 Using the Suspension Coil Summary data provided we calculated the summary table, below is the data

  Manufacturing_Lot Mean_PSI Median_PSI Variance_PSI STD_PSI
  <fct>                <dbl>      <dbl>        <dbl>   <dbl>
1 Lot1                 1500       1500         0.980   0.990
2 Lot2                 1500.      1500         7.47    2.73 
3 Lot3                 1496.      1498.      170.     13.0  

1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension 
coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design 
specification? Why or why not?

[Answer]: Based on the design specification Lot3 is rejected since it didn't meeet the variance limit of 
100 pounds per inch, while Lot1 nd Lot2 meets the design specification since the variance is 0.98 and 7.47
pounds per inch.

Suspension Coil T-Test

Based One Sample t-test collected sample data which meets following criteria

1. Sample size was large enough in our case we selected the sample data size as 100
2. Variance of the input data is similar (checked the sample data for multiple of them to make 
   sure variance difference is smaller)
3. Plotted input data to check if the data is normally distributed (adjusted skew)
4. Input data is number and continuous
5. Used random sample

Using Student t-test or One Sample t-test the p-value is more than confidence 0.05
so nullifying the Null hypothesis which states suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are not 
statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. So suspension coil'
PSI is statistically different from the mean population.

sample data1:

data:  log10(sample_data$PSI)
t = 0.29989, df = 99, p-value = 0.7649
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 3.175732
95 percent confidence interval:
 3.175356 3.176242
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 3.175799 


sample_data2:

data:  log10(sample_data1$PSI)
t = 0.072607, df = 99, p-value = 0.9423
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 3.175732
95 percent confidence interval:
 3.175239 3.176263
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 3.175751 

Using Two Sample t-test ( Welch's Two Sample t-test) with the same sample data, results holds true where suspension coil's PSI is
statistically different from the men population

data:  log10(sample_data$PSI) and log10(sample_data1$PSI)
t = 0.14136, df = 194.01, p-value = 0.8877
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.0006248812  0.0007213732
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 3.175799  3.175751 

Design your own Study:

Inorder to figure out MechaCar outperforms the competitors following would be the following metric,
I would collected

1. How many number of MechaCar's sold compared to the competitors
    a. classify them based on cost
    b. classify them based on fuel efficiency
    c. classify them based on maintenance cost
    b. classify them based on class (economy, compact, standard, luxury)
2. How many of costumers hold more than one MechaCar (to figure out happy customers who would become 
   brand ambasadar or marketing mouth)
